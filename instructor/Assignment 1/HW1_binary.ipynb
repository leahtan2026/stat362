    "\n",
    "1. **Shuffling the data**\n",
    "   - Many real-world datasets, especially in domains like **medicine**, are collected in sequential order (e.g., sorted by collection date, patient ID, or clinical visit number).  \n",
    "   - If you split the dataset without shuffling, the training set may contain only earlier cases and the test set may contain only later ones. This can introduce **temporal or ID-based bias** and reduce the model’s ability to generalize.  \n",
    "   - Shuffling ensures that the **distribution of samples is random**, giving both training and test sets a representative mix of patients and outcomes.  \n",
    "   - We use `random_state=0` to make the shuffle **reproducible**, so everyone gets the same randomized order.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Separating features and target**\n",
    "   - Define the **target variable** (the outcome you want to predict, e.g., disease status, biomarker level, or treatment response).  \n",
    "   - Select the **features** (independent variables, such as patient demographics, lab values, or imaging-derived metrics).  \n",

    "- Mimics a real-world scenario where the model encounters new patient cases.  \n",
    "- Provides an unbiased estimate of model performance. \n",
    "\n",

    "In this case, the accuracy and precision are both lower, but the recall is higher than our custom l2 model. This suggests to me that this model is identifying more of the true positive cases, but doing so very liberally as it is just applying more positive classifications in general, which in the process is falsely identifying them hence why precision and accuracy are down. This may be because of the closed-form solution for this, which may simplify an otherwise complex and uneven landscape and miss many of these unique cases that our customized gradient descent function can catch correctly."

    "## Task 5: Understanding Convergence - The `tol` Parameter Deep Dive **(15 points)**\n",
    "\n",
    "In many models that use gradient descent–based optimization, `tol` is a key hyperparameter.  \n",
    "In this task, you will explore its role using **logistic regression**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Understanding the Tolerance Parameter**\n",
    "The `tol` parameter in sklearn's LogisticRegression controls **when to stop the optimization process**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **What it measures**: Maximum change in the optimization objective between iterations\n",
    "- **Stopping criterion**: Training stops when improvement falls below this threshold\n",
    "- **Trade-off**: Tighter tolerance (smaller values) → more iterations → potentially better convergence\n",
    "- **Efficiency**: Looser tolerance (larger values) → fewer iterations → faster training but potentially suboptimal results\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Mathematical Context**\n",
    "For solver convergence, sklearn typically uses:\n",
    "$$|\\nabla J(\\mathbf{w}^{(t)}) - \\nabla J(\\mathbf{w}^{(t-1)})| < \\text{tol}$$\n",
    "Or for objective function change:\n",
    "$$|J(\\mathbf{w}^{(t)}) - J(\\mathbf{w}^{(t-1)})| < \\text{tol}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Expected Insights**\n",
    "\n",
    "Experiment with the following `tol` values to explore their impact on model convergence, training speed, and performance:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Typical Patterns You Should Observe:**\n",
    "- **Tighter tolerance (`1e-6`, `1e-7`)** → Training is slower but may yield slightly better performance.  \n",
    "- **Moderate tolerance (`1e-4`, `1e-5`)** → A good balance between speed and accuracy (close to scikit-learn’s default).  \n",
    "- **Loose tolerance (`1e-1`, `1e-2`)** → Faster training but may stop too early, leading to suboptimal results.  \n",
    "- **Performance plateau** → Beyond a certain level of tightness, further decreasing tolerance does not yield meaningful gains.  \n",
    "- **Convergence issues** → Extremely tight tolerance may require more iterations than allowed, preventing proper convergence.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ **Success Criteria**\n",
    "- [ ] Systematic testing across tolerance range (8+ values)\n",
    "- [ ] Comprehensive performance and efficiency metrics\n",
    "- [ ] Professional visualization with multiple perspectives\n",
    "- [ ] Clear identification of trade-offs and recommendations\n",
    "- [ ] Evidence-based analysis of sklearn's default choice"
