    "##  Introduction to K-Means Clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is K-Means Clustering?\n",
    "\n",
    "K-means is an **unsupervised learning algorithm** designed to automatically discover hidden patterns in data by grouping similar data points into clusters. It's one of the most widely used clustering algorithms in machine learning and data science.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Problem Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Input**: A training set $\\{x^{(1)}, x^{(2)}, ..., x^{(m)}\\}$ where each $x^{(i)} \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$\n",
    "* **Goal**: Partition the data into $K$ distinct, cohesive clusters\n",
    "* **Output**: Cluster assignments and centroids that minimize within-cluster variance\n",
    "\n",
    "### How K-Means Works: The Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "K-means follows an **iterative optimization approach** with two main phases:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Phase 1: Cluster Assignment**\n",
    "Assign each data point to the nearest centroid\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Phase 2: Centroid Update** \n",
    "Move centroids to the center of their assigned points\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Algorithm Pseudocode\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Step 1: Initialize centroids\n",
    "centroids = kMeans_init_centroids(X, K)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Step 2: Iterate until convergence\n",
    "for iteration in range(max_iterations):\n",
    "    # Phase 1: Assign points to closest centroids\n",
    "    idx = find_closest_centroids(X, centroids)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Phase 2: Update centroids to cluster means\n",
    "    centroids = compute_centroids(X, idx, K)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mathematical Foundation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Objective Function (Cost Function)**\n",
    "K-means minimizes the **Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$J = \\sum_{i=1}^{m} ||x^{(i)} - \\mu_{c^{(i)}}||^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $x^{(i)}$ = $i$-th data point\n",
    "- $\\mu_{c^{(i)}}$ = centroid of cluster assigned to $x^{(i)}$\n",
    "- $c^{(i)}$ = cluster assignment for point $i$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **The Two-Step Process**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Assignment Step**: For each point $x^{(i)}$, find the closest centroid:\n",
    "   $$c^{(i)} = \\arg\\min_j ||x^{(i)} - \\mu_j||^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Update Step**: For each centroid $k$, compute the mean of assigned points:\n",
    "   $$\\mu_k = \\frac{1}{|C_k|} \\sum_{i \\in C_k} x^{(i)}$$\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Where $C_k = \\{i : c^{(i)} = k\\}$ (set of points assigned to cluster $k$)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation Plan\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following sections, you'll implement the two core functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`find_closest_centroids()`** - Implements the assignment step\n",
    "2. **`compute_centroids()`** - Implements the update step\n",

    "## Clustering Performance Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "In unsupervised learning, we often assess clustering quality along three complementary dimensions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Internal validation** – measures structure, cohesion, and separation using only the feature data and predicted cluster labels.  \n",
    "2. **External validation** – compares clustering results against known ground truth labels (when available).  \n",
    "3. **Visual / qualitative inspection** – uses plots or projections for human interpretation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are the most commonly used evaluation methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Internal Metrics (No Ground Truth Needed)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Primary:** **Silhouette Score** *(recommended default)*  \n",
    "- **Intuition:** Measures how similar each point is to its own cluster versus the nearest other cluster.  \n",
    "- **Range:** –1 to 1. Higher is better (> 0.5 often good; near 0 ambiguous; negative indicates misassignment).  \n",
    "- **Strengths:** Scale-invariant, easy to compare across different `k` values, and broadly applicable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Other internal metrics:**\n",
    "- **Davies–Bouldin Index (DBI):** Average ratio of within-cluster scatter to between-centroid distance. Lower is better. Useful as a secondary check but less interpretable than Silhouette.  \n",
    "- *(Also seen: Calinski–Harabasz Index, Dunn Index – not used here.)*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example (Silhouette):**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from sklearn.cluster import KMeans\n",
    "from sklearn.metrics import silhouette_score\n",
    "\n",
    "k = 3\n",
    "labels = KMeans(n_clusters=k, random_state=42).fit_predict(X)\n",
    "score = silhouette_score(X, labels)\n",
    "print(f\"Silhouette Score (k={k}): {score:.3f}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "###  External Metrics (Require Ground Truth Labels)\n",
    "\n",
    "Use these only when **true labels are available** — e.g., for benchmarking on synthetic or annotated datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Primary:** **Adjusted Rand Index (ARI)**  \n",
    "- Adjusted for chance; range roughly –1 to 1 (1 = perfect agreement, 0 ≈ random label agreement).  \n",
    "- Robust, symmetric, and widely used.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Other:**  \n",
    "- **Normalized Mutual Information (NMI):** Measures shared information between cluster assignments and true labels, normalized to [0, 1].  \n",
    "  Less sensitive to label permutation than raw mutual information.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example (ARI & NMI):**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from sklearn.metrics import adjusted_rand_score, normalized_mutual_info_score\n",
    "\n",
    "# y_true: ground truth labels; labels: predicted cluster labels\n",
    "ari = adjusted_rand_score(y_true, labels)\n",
    "nmi = normalized_mutual_info_score(y_true, labels)\n",
    "print(f\"ARI: {ari:.3f}  |  NMI: {nmi:.3f}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Visual / Qualitative Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Scatter plots** using 2D data or PCA / t-SNE / UMAP projections for high-dimensional datasets.  \n",
    "- **Centroid or prototype visualization** (e.g., mean images in image clustering).  \n",
    "- **Cluster size distribution** to detect imbalance or fragmentation.  \n",
    "- **Decision boundary overlays** (when feasible) for visual intuition.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Choosing What to Report\n",
    "\n",
    "- **No ground truth:** Use **Silhouette Score** across candidate **`k`** values (optionally add DBI) and visualizations.  \n",
    "- **With ground truth:** Report **ARI** (and optionally **NMI**) along with an internal metric for structural insight.  \n",
    "- Always include **visualizations** — metrics alone can miss geometric or topological issues (e.g., elongated or chained clusters).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Pitfalls\n",
    "\n",
    "- Very high Silhouette with very small clusters can indicate **over-segmentation**.  \n",
    "- Low ARI/NMI doesn’t always mean failure — ground truth labels may encode **semantic** rather than geometric differences.  \n",
    "- High internal metrics do not guarantee **usefulness for downstream tasks** — always consider domain context.\n"
