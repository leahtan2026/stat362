    "## 1 - The Problem of Very Deep Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern neural networks have grown dramatically in depth — from a few layers (e.g., AlexNet) to hundreds in today’s architectures. Deeper models can represent more complex functions and learn hierarchical features, from simple edges in early layers to abstract concepts in deeper layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, simply stacking more layers does **not** always improve performance. A major challenge is the **vanishing gradient problem**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Vanishing Gradients\n",
    "\n",
    "During backpropagation, gradients flow from the final layer back to earlier layers. At each step, gradients are multiplied by weight matrices (and activation derivatives). In very deep networks, this can cause gradients to:\n",
    "\n",
    "-  **Shrink exponentially** → approach zero (**vanishing gradients**)  \n",
    "-  **Grow exponentially** → explode to large values (**exploding gradients**, less common)\n",
    "\n",
    "Even with:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ✅ Proper weight initialization  \n",
    "- ✅ ReLU activations  \n",
    "- ✅ Batch normalization  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Training very deep networks is still harder** because gradients struggle to flow backward through many layers.  \n",
    "Result: **Early layers learn slowly or stop learning** → inefficient training and poor performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "###  What You Observe During Training\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient norms for earlier layers typically decrease rapidly:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Earlier layers receive very weak learning signal → slow or stalled learning**\n",
    "\n",
    "*(See figure below — earlier layers' gradients decay faster)*\n",

    "<caption><center> <u> <font color='purple'> <b>Figure 1</b> </u><font color='purple'>  : <b>Vanishing gradient</b> <br> The speed of learning decreases very rapidly for the early layers as the network trains </center></caption>\n",

    "**Key takeaway:**  \n",
    "> Gradient flow weakens as networks deepen, making optimization difficult without special architectural mechanisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "###  What's Next?\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this, modern architectures introduce **skip (residual) connections**, which allow gradients to bypass layers and flow more easily.\n",

    "### 2.0 - The Core Idea: Skip Connections\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Key Innovation: Learning Residuals Instead of Direct Mappings\n",
    "\n",
    "**Traditional approach**: Learn a direct mapping $H(x)$ from input $x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**ResNet approach**: Learn a residual function $F(x)$ such that:\n",
    "\n",

    "where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $x$ is the input (identity/shortcut)\n",
    "- $F(x)$ is the residual learned by the stacked layers\n",
    "- $H(x)$ is the final output\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why is this easier to optimize?**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **If optimal mapping is close to identity** ($H(x) \\approx x$), it's easier to learn $F(x) \\approx 0$ than to learn $H(x) = x$ directly\n",
    "2. **Gradient flow**: During backpropagation, gradients can flow through both:\n",
    "   - The main path: $\\frac{\\partial F(x)}{\\partial x}$\n",
    "   - The shortcut: $\\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial x} = 1$ (direct path with gradient = 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "This ensures at least some gradient always reaches earlier layers!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits of Residual Learning**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Traditional Deep Networks | Residual Networks (ResNets) |\n",
    "|---------------------------|----------------------------|\n",
    "| Gradients vanish exponentially | Skip connections provide gradient highway |\n",
    "| Harder to optimize as depth increases | Easy to optimize even with 100+ layers |\n",
    "| Adding layers can hurt performance | Adding layers rarely hurts (can learn identity) |\n",
    "| Requires careful initialization | More robust to initialization |\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Two Types of ResNet Blocks\n",
    "\n",
    "By stacking these ResNet blocks on top of each other, you can form very deep networks. The architecture uses two main block types based on whether input/output dimensions match:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Identity Block** — When input and output dimensions are the **same**\n",
    "2. **Convolutional Block** — When dimensions **differ** (e.g., spatial downsampling or channel expansion)\n",

    "#### 2.2 - The Convolutional Block\n",
    "\n",
    "You've mastered the identity block! Now let's tackle the **convolutional block** — the second essential building block in ResNet.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### When to Use Convolutional Blocks\n",
    "\n",
    "Use this block when **input and output dimensions DON'T match**, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "-  **Spatial downsampling**: Reducing height/width (e.g., 32×32 → 16×16)\n",
    "-  **Channel expansion**: Increasing depth (e.g., 128 channels → 256 channels)\n",
    "-  **Transitioning between stages** in the network\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Key Difference: Shortcut Path Has a Convolution\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/convblock_kiank.png\" style=\"width:650px;height:150px;\">\n",
    "<caption><center> <u> <font color='purple'> <b>Figure 5</b> </u><font color='purple'>  : <b>Convolutional block</b> </center></caption>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Unlike the identity block**, the shortcut path contains:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **CONV2D layer**: Transforms input to match output dimensions\n",
    "- **BatchNorm**: Normalizes the transformed shortcut\n",
    "- **No activation**: Shortcut applies only a linear transformation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why is this needed?**\n",
    "\n",
    "For the final addition to work, both paths must have **matching dimensions**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# This MUST work:\n",
    "output = main_path_output + shortcut_output  # Shapes must match!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If input is `(32, 32, 128)` and output should be `(16, 16, 256)`:\n",
    "- Main path reduces spatial dimensions and expands channels\n",
    "- Shortcut path ALSO must transform `(32, 32, 128)` → `(16, 16, 256)`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#####  Architecture Details\n",
    "\n",
    "**Main Path** (same as identity block, but with stride):\n",
    "\n",
    "**First Component**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **CONV2D**: $F_1$ filters, (1,1), **stride (s,s)**, padding='valid'\n",
    "  -  **Stride s**: This is where spatial downsampling happens!\n",
    "  - *Name*: `conv_name_base + '2a'`\n",
    "- **BatchNorm**: `bn_name_base + '2a'`\n",
    "- **Activation**: ReLU\n",
    "\n",
    "**Second Component**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **CONV2D**: $F_2$ filters, (f,f), stride (1,1), padding='same'\n",
    "  - *Name*: `conv_name_base + '2b'`\n",
    "- **BatchNorm**: `bn_name_base + '2b'`\n",
    "- **Activation**: ReLU\n",
    "\n",
    "**Third Component**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **CONV2D**: $F_3$ filters, (1,1), stride (1,1), padding='valid'\n",
    "  - *Name*: `conv_name_base + '2c'`\n",
    "- **BatchNorm**: `bn_name_base + '2c'`\n",
    "- **No activation** here\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Shortcut Path** (NEW! This is what makes it different):\n",
    "\n",
    "- **CONV2D**: $F_3$ filters, (1,1), **stride (s,s)**, padding='valid'\n",
    "  -  **Same stride as first component** → matches spatial dimensions\n",
    "  -  **Same number of filters as third component** → matches channels\n",
    "  - *Name*: `conv_name_base + '1'`\n",
    "- **BatchNorm**: `bn_name_base + '1'`\n",
    "- **No activation** (keeps it as a linear projection)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Final Step**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Add**: Main path + Shortcut path\n",
    "- **Activation**: ReLU on sum\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#####  Dimension Transformation Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's trace dimensions through a convolutional block:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input**: `(H, W, C_in)` = `(32, 32, 128)`  \n",
    "**Parameters**: `s=2`, `filters=[64, 64, 256]`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Main Path**:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input:          (32, 32, 128)\n",
    "↓ Conv 1×1, s=2, 64 filters\n",
    "                (16, 16, 64)   ← stride 2 reduces spatial dims\n",
    "↓ Conv 3×3, s=1, 64 filters\n",
    "                (16, 16, 64)   ← same padding preserves dims\n",
    "↓ Conv 1×1, s=1, 256 filters\n",
    "Main output:    (16, 16, 256)  ← expand to final channels\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Shortcut Path**:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input:          (32, 32, 128)\n",
    "↓ Conv 1×1, s=2, 256 filters\n",
    "Shortcut:       (16, 16, 256)  ← matches main path!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Addition**: `(16, 16, 256)` + `(16, 16, 256)` = `(16, 16, 256)` ✅\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#####  Why No Activation on Shortcut?\n",
    "\n",
    "The shortcut represents the **identity (or linear projection) of the input**. Adding a non-linearity would:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ❌ Break the gradient highway property\n",
    "- ❌ Make it harder to learn identity mappings\n",
    "- ❌ Reduce the effectiveness of skip connections\n",
    "\n",
    "The shortcut should be a **pure information pathway**, while the main path learns non-linear transformations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 2: Implement the Convolutional Block\n",
    "\n",
    "We've implemented the first component of the main path. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Your task**: Complete the rest.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What to implement**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Second and third components of main path\n",
    "2. **Entire shortcut path** (this is the new part!)\n",
    "3. Final addition and activation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key reminders**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use stride `(s,s)` in the FIRST main path conv AND the shortcut conv\n",
    "- Shortcut has $F_3$ filters (same as third component output)\n",
    "- No ReLU on shortcut path or after third component (only after final addition)\n",
    "\n",
    "**References**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Conv2D](https://keras.io/layers/convolutional/#conv2d)\n",
    "- [BatchNorm](https://keras.io/layers/normalization/#batchnormalization) (use `axis=3`)\n",
    "- [Activation](https://keras.io/layers/core/#activation): `Activation('relu')(X)`\n",
